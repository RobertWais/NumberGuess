# NumberGuess
Choose which number is greater than the other

This was the first project I was given in Android class of Spring 2018 semester. For fun I have decided
to do all of the projects given in swift as well.

The project is fairly simple, the user chooses which number is greater than the other.

If the user is wrong, "wrong" is displayed as a Android like toast view, if correct it is displayed as "correct".
The application also keeps a simple score. For each right answer the user receives one point, if wrong the user
loses a point.

To display the toast like view I imported Toast_Swift (version 3.0.1) through Cocoapods.
